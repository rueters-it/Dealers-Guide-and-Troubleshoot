## Understanding the Issue

The "not secure" error you're encountering when accessing the New Holland CE merchandising portal is likely related to SSL certificate issues or HTTPS configuration problems, which means the connection between your browser and the website is not encrypted and therefore not secure. It signifies a potential security risk due to issues with the website's security configuration or an expired/invalid SSL certificate.

## Common Causes 
1. Website configuration (on New Holland CE website admin side)
2. Browser issues (outdate browser, browser chache and cookies, browser extension or antivirus software interference, incorrect date/time)

## Troubleshoot
1. Ensure your web browser is updated to the current version.
2. Clear your browser's cache and cookies.
3. Disable browser extensions or temporarily disable your antivirus software to see if it resolves the issue (consult with IT admin first)
4. Check and update your device's date and time settings.
5. If the issue persists, contact the IT admin and they will resolve with the New Holland CE support team for assistance.
